# Untested prototype firmware

Supposedly works with "microswitch" keyboards.

![default pinout](pinouts/uSwitch.png)

Scans at 200kHz, so should have plenty of time detecting those 60us pulses from pulse switches.

Please reuse pullup resistors from original keyboard - but if you can't and scan doesn't work with bare switches - go to TopDesign.cysch and change pins to resistive pullup and initial drive state to "High (1)". That should do the trick.

If you can get it working - let me know :D
