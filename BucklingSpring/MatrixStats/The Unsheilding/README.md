This is No. 1 PCB.

Columns 1-7 (0-based) have ground traces around the pads removed.

Tests on key [5, 4] and around.

Noise ~2 -> ~4, signal ~8 -> ~12

Full unshielding leads to ladder-like signal, adjacent columns sap the juice out of our cap.

Removing just the part in the middle of the plate gets signal from 8 to 9-10, no ladder.
