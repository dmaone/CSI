This is no. 1 PCB.

Columns 1-7 (0-based) have ground traces around the pads removed - see other folder for effects.

Keys [5, 4] and [2, 14] have crude vias made by drilling 0.4mm hole thru the pad and connecting planes with 0.2mm copper wire.

The effect appears to be ~3x stronger signal, with negligible effect when not pressed - see the excel.

Reducing pad area to bottom 10mm doesn't cause noticeable degradation in ungrounded scenario.

Gap between conductive surface and PCB matters _greatly_.
